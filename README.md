# Arduino --> 1 Program into lots of Sketches
Arduino Code Projects
  MultiTasking >> Lately I have been obsessed with using Switch/Case to have menu driven sketches wrapped up into one Program.  This is fun because I can put lots of small sketches into one upload.  This has been particularly helpful for me to copy and past useful portions of sketches to generate new ones.
  
  OOP >> Object oriented Programs!  This is awesome, but I have only seen a few sketches written in OOP... Libraries definitely are, but I'm not at that level yet. Need to study this guys example:  https://github.com/balazspekar/arduino-oop-sample
